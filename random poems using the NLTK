#Phyton code that generates random poems using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK):
import random
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg

# Load a corpus of texts
text = gutenberg.raw("blake-poems.txt")

# Tokenize the text into sentences
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)

# Pick a random sentence to start the poem
poem = [random.choice(sentences)]

# Keep adding sentences until the poem is the desired length
while len(poem) < 4:
    next_sentence = random.choice(sentences)
    if next_sentence not in poem:
        poem.append(next_sentence)

# Print the resulting poem
for sentence in poem:
    print(sentence)
